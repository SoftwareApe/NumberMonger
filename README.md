# NumberMonger

Lightweight extension to VSCode to help you deal with numbers. No settings, everything can be configured through the command bar.

## Features

NumberMonger lets you
1. sum up sequences of numbers in floating point, integer, hexidecimal or binary representation
2. use multiple cursors to insert sequences of numbers with arbitrary initial values and step 
3. insert sequences of random integers
4. convert between hexadecimal, binary and decimal numbers

All features are accessed through the command bar (ctrl+p).

* Sum Sequence, even when they're inside arrays! Also shows mean, standard deviation and median of the sequence.
*Hint*: The selected value gets copied to clipboard, press Esc if you want to keep your cliboard
